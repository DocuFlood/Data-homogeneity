This MATLAB code serves as a tool for conducting a homogeneity test using the Pettitt method.
This MATLAB code serves as a tool for conducting a homogeneity test using the Pettitt method. The Pettitt test is a statistical technique used to evaluate time series data for significant structural breaks or inhomogeneities. This code takes a dataset as input and calculates the Pettitt test statistic (U) for various potential split points within the data. It then identifies the split point that results in the maximum U, signifying the point with the most significant change. By comparing this maximum U to a critical value based on a predefined significance level, the code helps make a determination about the data's homogeneity
